# TableauProjects
Greetings! I'm excited to celebrate my first year on LinkedIn by showcasing a dynamic data visualization project I've crafted using Tableau. This project is segmented into four distinct categories:

1. Message Leaderboard: This tracks the volume of messages I've exchanged with my connections.
2. Company Breakdown: Here, we count the diversity of companies where my connections are currently employed.
3. First Name Tally: A fun and interesting count of how many of my connections share the same first name.
4. Connection Growth Chart: A snapshot of my expanding network, demonstrating the overall growth of my LinkedIn connections.

For a comprehensive view of these interactive visuals, kindly refer to my Tableau public profile linked here https://prod-useast-b.online.tableau.com/t/jahshantihenrycom/views/LinkedInData/Dashboard1. Your time and interest are greatly appreciated. Thank you for joining me on this journey!
